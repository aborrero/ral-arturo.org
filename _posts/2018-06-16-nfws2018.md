This weekend we had Netfilter Workshop 2018 in Berlin, Germany.

Lots of interesting talks happened, mostly surrounding nftables and how to
move forward from the iptables legacy world to the new, modern nft framework.

In a nutshell, the Netfilter project, the FLOSS community driven project, has
agreed to consider iptables as a legacy tool. This confidence comes from the
maturity of the nftables framework, which is fairly fully-compliant with the
old iptables API, including extensions (matches and targets).

<!--more-->

Starting now, next iptables upstream releases will include the old iptables
binary as **/sbin/iptables-legacy**, and the same for the other friends.

To summarize:

* /sbin/iptables-legacy
* /sbin/iptables-legacy-save
* /sbin/iptables-legacy-restore 
* /sbin/ip6tables-legacy
* /sbin/ip6tables-legacy-save
* /sbin/ip6tables-legacy-restore
* /sbin/arptables-legacy
* /sbin/ebtables-legacy

The new binary will be using the nf_tables kernel backend instead, what was
formely known as 'iptables-compat'. Should you find some rough edges with the
new binary, you could always use the old -legacy tools.
This is for people who want to keep using the old iptables semantics, but the
recommendation is to migrate to nftables as soon as possible.

Moving to nftables will add the benefits of improved performance, new features,
new semantics, and in general, a modern framework.
All major distributions will implement these changes soon, including RedHat,
Fedora, CentOS, Suse, Debian and derivatives.
We also had some talks regarding firewalld, the firewalling service in use by
some rpm-based distros. They gained support for nftables starting with v0.6.0.
This is great news, since firewalld is the main firewalling top-level mechanism
in these distributions.
Good news is that the libnftables high level API is in great shape. It recently
gained a new high level JSON API thanks to Phil Sutter. The firewalld tool
will use this new JSON API soon.

I gave a talk about the status of Netfilter software packages at Debian, and
shared my plans to implement these iptables -> nftables changes in the near
future.

We also had an interesting talk by a CloudFlare engineer about how they use
the TPROXY Netfilter infraestructure to serve thousand customers. Some
discussion happened about caveats and improvements and how nftables could be a
better fit if it gains TPROXY-like features.
In the field of networking at scale, some vmware engineers also joined the
conversation for nft connlimit and nf_conncount, a new approach in nftables
for rate-limiting/policing based on conntrack data.
This was followed up by a presentation by Pablo Neira about the new flow
offload infrastructure for nftables, which can act as a complete kernel bypass
in case of packet forwarding.

Jozsef Kadlecsik shared a deep and detailed investigation on ipset vs nftables
and how we could match both frameworks. He gave an overview of what's missing,
what's already there and what could be a benefit from users migrating from
ipset to nftables.

We had some space for load-balancing as well. Laura Garc√≠a shared the last news
regarding the nftlb project, the nftables-based load balancer. She shared some
interesting numbers about how reptoline affects Netfilter performance. She
mentioned that the impact of reptoline is about 17% in nftables and 40% for
iptables for her use cases.

Florian Westphal gave a talk regarding br_netfilter and how we could improve
the linux kernel networking stack from the Netfilter point of view for bridge
use cases. Right now all sorts of nasty things are done to store required
information and context for packets traveling bridges (which may need to be
evaluated by Netfilter). We have a lot of marging for improvement and Florian's
plan is to invest time in these.

We had a very interesting legal talk by Dr. Till Jaeger regarding GPL
enforcement in Germany, related to the Patrick McHardly situation. Some good
work is being done in this field to defend the community against activities
which hurts the interest of all the Linux users and developers.

Harsha Sharma, 18 years old from India, gave a talk explaining her work on
nftables to the rest of Netfilter contributors. This is possible thanks to
internship programs like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code.
Varsha and Harsha, both are so brave for traveling so far from home to join a
mostly european-white-men-only meeting. We where joined by 3 women this
workshop and I would like to believe this is a symbol of our inclusiveness, of
being a healthy community.

The workshop was sponsorized by vmware, zevenet, redhat, intra2net, oisf,
stamus networks, and suricata.

In October 2023, I departed from the [Wikimedia Foundation][wmf], the non-profit organization
behind well-known projects like Wikipedia and others, to [join Spryker][spryker].

However, in January 2024 Spryker conducted a round of layoffs reportedly due to budget and business reasons.
I was among those affected, being let go just three months after joining the company.

Fortunately, the [Wikimedia Cloud Services team][wmcs], where I previously worked, was still seeking to backfill my
position, so I reached out to them. They graciously welcomed me back as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer,
in the same team and position as before.

Although this three-month career "detour" wasn't the outcome I initially envisioned, I found it to be a valuable experience.
During this time, I gained knowledge in a new tech stack, based on AWS, and discovered new engineering methodologies.
Additionally, I had the opportunity to meet some wonderful individuals. I believe I have emerged stronger from this experience.

Returning to the Wikimedia Foundation is truly motivating. It feels privileged to be part of this mature organization,
its community, and movement, with its inspiring [mission][mission] and [values][values].

In addition, I'm hoping that this also means I can once again dedicate a bit more attention to my FLOSS activities,
such as my duties within the Debian project.

My email address is back online: [aborrero@wikimedia.org](mailto:aborrero@wikimedia.org).
You can find me again in the IRC libera.chat server, in the usual wikimedia channels, nick _arturo_.

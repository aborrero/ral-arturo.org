Last year, I decided to start participating in the Debian LTS and ELTS projects. It was a great opportunity to engage in
something new within the Debian community. I had been following these projects for many years, observing their evolution
and how they gained traction both within the ecosystem and across the industry.

I was curious to explore how contributors were working internally — especially how they managed security patching and
remediation for older software. I've always felt this was a particularly challenging area, and I was fortunate to
experience it firsthand.

As of April 2025, the [Debian LTS project](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) was primarily focused on providing security
maintenance for Debian 11 *Bullseye*. Meanwhile, the [Debian ELTS project](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Extended) was
targeting Debian 8 *Jessie*, Debian 9 *Stretch*, and Debian 10 *Buster*.

During my time with the projects, I worked on a variety of packages and CVEs. Some of the most notable ones include:

- [bluez](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/bluez)
- [nss](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/nss)
- [libmojolicious-perl](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/libmojolicious-perl)
- [uw-imap](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/uw-imap)
- [dnsmasq](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/dnsmasq)
- [firmware-nonfree](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/firmware-nonfree)
- [activemq](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/activemq)
- [frr](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/frr)
- [libmodbus](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/libmodbus)

There are several technical highlights I'd like to share — things I learned or had to apply while participating:

- **CI/CD pipelines**: We used CI/CD pipelines on [salsa.debian.org](https://salsa.debian.org) all the times to automate
  tasks such as building, linting, and testing packages. For any package I worked on that lacked CI/CD integration,
  setting it up became my first step.

- **autopkgtest**: There's a strong emphasis on `autopkgtest` as the mechanism for running functional tests and ensuring
  that security patches don’t introduce regressions. I contributed by both extending existing test suites and writing
  new ones from scratch.

- **Toolchain complexity for older releases**: Working with older Debian versions like *Jessie* brought some unique
  challenges. Getting a development environment up and running often meant troubleshooting issues with `sbuild` chroots,
  `qemu` images, and other tools that don't “just work” like they tend to on Debian stable.

- **Community collaboration**: The people involved in LTS and ELTS are extremely helpful and collaborative. Requests for
  help, code reviews, and general feedback were usually answered quickly.

- **Shared ownership**: This collaborative culture also meant that contributors would regularly pick up work left by
  others or hand off their own tasks when needed. That mutual support made a big difference.

- **Backporting security fixes**: This is probably the most intense —and most rewarding— activity. It involves manually
  adapting patches to work on older codebases when upstream patches don't apply cleanly. This requires deep code
  understanding and thorough testing.

- **Upstream collaboration**: Reaching out to upstream developers was a key part of my workflow. I often asked if they
  could provide patches for older versions or at least review my backports. Sometimes they were available, but most of
  the time, the responsibility remained on us.

- **Diverse tech stack**: The work exposed me to a wide range of programming languages and frameworks—Python, Java, C,
  Perl, and more. Unsurprisingly, some modern languages (like Go) are less prevalent in older releases like *Jessie*.

- **Security team interaction**: I had frequent contact with the core Debian Security Team—the folks responsible for
  security in Debian stable. This gave me a broader perspective on how Debian handles security holistically.

In March 2025, I decided to scale back my involvement in the projects due to some changes in my personal
life. Still, this experience has been one of the highlights of my career, and I would definitely recommend it to others.

I’m very grateful for the warm welcome I received from the LTS/ELTS community, and I don’t rule out the possibility of
rejoining the LTS/ELTS efforts in the future.

The Debian LTS/ELTS projects are currently coordinated by folks at [Freexian](https://www.freexian.com/).
Many thanks to Freexian and [sponsors](https://www.freexian.com/lts/debian/#sponsors) for providing this opportunity!

A couple of weeks ago I attended the [Wikimania 2019][wikimania] conference in
Stockholm, Sweden. This is the general and global conference for the Wikimedia
movement, in which people interested in free knowledge gather together for a
few days. The event happens annually, and this was my first time attending such
conference.
Wikimania 2019 main program ran for 3 days, but we had 2 pre-conference days in
which a [hackathon][hackathon] was held.

The venue was an amazing building in the Stockholm University,
[Aula Magna][aulamagna].

The hackathon reunited technical contributors, such as developers, which are
interested in a variety of technical challenges in the wiki movement. You
can find in the hackathon people interested in wiki edits automation, research,
anti harassment tools and also infrastructure engineering and architecture,
among other things.

My full time job is at the Wikimedia Cloud Services team. We provide platforms
and services for wikimedia movement collaborators who want to perform technical
tasks and contributions. Some examples of what we provide:

* a public cloud service based on Openstack, AKA IaaS. We call this [CloudVPS][cloudvps].
* a PaaS product, based on Kubernetes and GridEngine. We call this [Toolforge][toolforge].
* direct access to wiki databases in both SQL and XML format.
* several other software products, like [Quarry][quarry], [PAWS][paws], etc.

These services are widely used in the wiki community. About 40% of total edits
to wiki projects come from software running in our platform. Some coworkers and
myself attended the hackathon to provide support related to these tools and
services, and to introduce them to new contributors.

![Talk][talk]

We had session/talk called [Introduction to Wikimedia Cloud Services][slides] the
first day of the hackathon, and folks showed genuine interests in the things we
offer. Some stuff I did during the hackathon included creating lots of
Toolforge accounts, fixing issues in Cloud VPS projects, talks with many people
about related technical topics, etc.

Once the hackathon ended, the main program conference started. I was amazed to
see how vibrant the wiki movement is. Seeing people from all over the world
sharing such a great mission and goals was really inspiring and I truly felt
grateful for being part of it. The conference is joined by many wiki
enthusiasts, editors and other volunteers from many organizations and local
wiki chapters. For the record, the amount of paid staff from the Wikimedia
Foundation is limited.

Honestly, until I attended this conference I was not aware of the scope and
size of the movement and the variety of topics and approaches that involve
free knowledge, the ultimate goal, which is not a far-fetched mission: we are
in good track despite the many challenges :-)

After the conference, we had another week in Stockholm for a
[Tehcnical Engagement team][te] offsite.

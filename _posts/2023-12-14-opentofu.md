I recently started playing with Terraform/[OpenTofu][opentofu] almost on a daily basis.

The other day I was working with Amazon Managed Prometheus (or AMP), and wanted to define prometheus alert rules on YAML files.

I decided that I needed a way to put the alerts on a bunch of files, and then load them by the declarative code, on the correct
AMP workspace.

<!--more-->

I came up with this code pattern that I'm sharing here, for my future reference, and in case it is interesting to someone else.

The YAML file where I specify the AMP workspace, and where the alert rule files live:

```yaml
---
alert_files:
  my_alerts_production:
    amp:
      workspace: "production"
    files: "alert_rules/production/*.yaml"
  my_alerts_staging:
    amp:
      workspace: "staging"
    files: "alert_rules/staging/*.yaml"
```

Note the `files` entry contains a file pattern. I will later expand the pattern using the [fileset()][fileset] function.

Each rule file would be something like this:

```yaml
---
name: "my_rule_namespace"
rule_data: |
  # this is prometheus-specific config
  groups:
    - name: "example_alert_group"
      rules:
      - alert: Example_Alert_Cpu
        # just arbitrary values, to produce an example alert
        expr: avg(rate(ecs_cpu_seconds_total{container=~"something"}[2m])) > 1
        for: 10s
        annotations:
          summary: "CPU usage is too high"
          description: "The container average CPU usage is too high."
```

I'm interested in the data structure mutating into something similar to this:

```yaml
---
alert_files:
  my_alerts_production:
    amp:
      workspace: "production"
    alerts_data:
      - name: rule_namespace_1
        rule_data: |
          # actual alert definition here
          [..]
      - name: rule_namespace_2
        rule_data: |
          # actual alert definition here
          [..]

  my_alerts_staging:
    amp:
      workspace: "staging"
    alerts_data:
      - name: rule_namespace_1
        rule_data: |
          # actual alert definition here
          [..]
      - name: rule_namespace_2
        rule_data: |
          # actual alert definition here
          [..]
```

This is the algorithm that does the trick:

```terraform
locals {
  alerts_config = {
    for x, y in {
      for k, v in local.config.alert_files :
      k => {
        amp : (v.amp),
        files : fileset("", v.files)
      }
      } : x => {
      amp : (y.amp),
      alertmanager_data : [
        for z in(y.files) :
        yamldecode(file(z))
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Because the declarative nature of the Terraform/OpenTofu language, I needed to implement 3 different for loops. Each loop
reads the map and transforms it in some way, passing the result into the next loop. A bit convoluted if you ask me.

To explain the logic, I think it makes more sense to read it from inside out.

First loop:
```terraform
    for k, v in local.config.alert_files :
    k => {
        amp : (v.amp),
        files : fileset("", v.files)
    }
```

This loop iterates the input YAML map in key-value pairs, remapping each `amp` entry, and expanding the file globs using the
`fileset()` into a temporal `files` entry.

Second loop:
```terraform
    for x, y in {
        # previous fileset() loop
      } : x => {
      amp : (y.amp),
      alertmanager_data : [
        # yamldecode() loop
      ]
    }
```

This intermediate loop is responsible for building the final data structure. It iterates the previous `fileset()` loop
to remap it calling the next loop, the `yamldecode()` one. Note how the `amp` entry is being "rebuilt" in each remap (first loop
and this one), otherwise we would lose it!

Third loop:
```terraform
    alertmanager_data : [
        for z in(y.files) :
        yamldecode(file(z))
    ]
```

And finally, this is maybe the easiest loop of the 3, we iterate the temporal `file` entry that was created in the first loop,
calling `yamldecode()` for each of the file names generated by `fileset()`.

The resulting data structure should allow you to easily create resources later in a [for_each][foreach] loop.

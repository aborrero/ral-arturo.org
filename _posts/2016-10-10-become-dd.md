The moment has come. You may contact me now at
[arturo@debian.org](mailto:arturo@debian.org) :-)

After almost 6 months of tough [NM process][nm], the waiting is over. I have
achieved the goal I set to myself back in 2011: become Debian Developer.

This is a professional and personal victory.

I would like to mention many people who have been important for this to
happen. But they all know, no need to create a list here. Thanks!

This weekend I was in the [mountains][vejeta_post] and had no internet
conection at all.
When I arrived back to home, I discovered an email from Debian System
Administrators on behalf of The Debian New Maintainer Team, in which
they let me know that my official DD account has been created.

During the last 6 month I have tried to imagine the moment in which the
process is finally completed (yes, I have been a bit impatient).
At the end, the magical moment in the mountains was joined with the joy of
the DD account. Courious how things happens sometimes.

Here a pic of this mountain day, with my adventure friends.
I am the first in the left.

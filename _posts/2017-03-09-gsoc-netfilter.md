Great news! The [Netfilter project][netfilter] has been elected by Google to
be a mentoring organization in this year Google Summer of Code program.
Following the pattern of the last years, Google seems to realise and support
the importance of this software project in the Linux ecosystem.

I will be proudly mentoring some student this 2017 year, along with Eric
Leblond and of course Pablo Neira.

The focus of the Netfilter project has been in [nftables][nftables] for the
last years, and the students joining our community will likely work on the
new framework.

For prospective students: there is an [ideas][ideas] document which you must
read. The policy in the Netfilter project is to encourage students to send
patches _before_ they are elected to join us. Therefore, a good starting point
is to subscribe to the [mailing lists][lists], download the
[git code repositories][git], build by hand the projects (compilation) and
look at the [bugzilla][bugzilla] (registration required).

Due to this type of internships and programs, I believe is interesting to note
the ascending involvement of women in the last years. I can remember right now:
Ana Rey ([@AnaRB][ana]), Shivani Bhardwaj ([@tuxish][shivani]), Laura Garc√≠a and
Elise Lennion ([blog][elise]).

On a side note, [Debian is not participating in GSoC this year][debian] :-(

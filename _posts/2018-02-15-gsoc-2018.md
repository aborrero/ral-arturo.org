The other day Google published the list of [accepted projects][projects] for
this year round of Google Summer of Code. Many organizations were accepted,
and there are 3 that are specially interesting to me: Netfilter, Wikimedia
Foundation and Debian.

<!--more-->

The GSoC initiative is a great opportunity to enter the professional FLOSS
world, knowing more of your favorite project, having a mentor and earning a
stipend along the way.

The Netfilter project (check the [dashboard][nf]) has published a list of
[ideas][nf_ideas] for students to work on. I will likely be mentoring here.
Be aware that students who submit patches as part of the warmup period are
more likely to be elected.

The Debian project (check the [dashboard][debian]) also has a great list of
[proposals][debian_ideas] in a variety of different technologies, from
packaging to Android, also with some web and backend project ideas.
Is great to see again Debian participating in GSoC. Last year we weren't
present.

The Wikimedia Foundation (check the [dashboard][wmf]) has like
[8 projects][wmf_ideas] for students to work on, also with different scopes,
including an interesting project for improving [Toolforge][toolforge].

So, students, don't be afraid to participate! There are a lot of projects,
different technologies and people to work with, so there should be one waiting
for you.

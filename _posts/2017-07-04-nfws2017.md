I was invited to attend the [Netfilter Workshop 2017][link] in Faro, Portugal
this week, so I'm here with all the folks enjoying some days of talks,
discussions and hacking around Netfilter and general linux networking.

The Coreteam of the Netfilter project, with active members Pablo Neira Ayuso
(head), Jozsef Kadlecsik, Eric Leblond and Florian Westphal have invited me
to join them, and the appointment has happened today.

You may contact me now at my new email address:

This is the result of my continued contribution to the Netfilter project since
several years now (probably since 2012-2013).
I'm really happy with this, and I appreciate their recognition. I will do my
best in this new position. Thanks!

Regarding the workshop itself, we are having lots of interesting talks and
discussions about the state of the Netfilter technology, open issues, missing
features and where to go in the future.

Really interesting!

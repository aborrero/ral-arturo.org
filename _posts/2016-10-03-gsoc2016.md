This year, I mentored a student in Google Summer of Code 2016.

I have been involved as a mentor in the Netfilter project, working
with nftables and the translation layer between iptables and nft.

<!--more-->

The nftables framework is ready to use. I myself plan to deploy several
production firewalls during upcoming months.

Google just send me some goodies, a tshirt and a sticker.

Thanks! :-)
